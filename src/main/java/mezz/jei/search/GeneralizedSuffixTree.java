/**
 * A Generalized Suffix Tree, based on the Ukkonen's paper "On-line construction of suffix trees"
 * http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf
 * <p>
 * Allows for fast storage and fast(er) retrieval by creating a tree-based index out of a set of strings.
 * Unlike common suffix trees, which are generally used to build an index out of one (very) long string,
 * a Generalized Suffix Tree can be used to build an index over many strings.
 * <p>
 * Its main operations are put and search:
 * Put adds the given key to the index, allowing for later retrieval of the given value.
 * Search can be used to retrieve the set of all the values that were put in the index with keys that contain a given input.
 * <p>
 * In particular, after put(K, V), search(H) will return a set containing V for any string H that is substring of K.
 * <p>
 * The overall complexity of the retrieval operation (search) is O(m) where m is the length of the string to search within the index.
 * <p>
 * Although the implementation is based on the original design by Ukkonen, there are a few aspects where it differs significantly.
 * <p>
 * The tree is composed of a set of nodes and labeled edges. The labels on the edges can have any length as long as it's greater than 0.
 * The only constraint is that no two edges going out from the same node will start with the same character.
 * <p>
 * Because of this, a given (startNode, stringSuffix) pair can denote a unique path within the tree, and it is the path (if any) that can be
 * composed by sequentially traversing all the edges (e1, e2, ...) starting from startNode such that (e1.label + e2.label + ...) is equal
 * to the stringSuffix.
 * See the search method for details.
 * <p>
 * The union of all the edge labels from the root to a given leaf node denotes the set of the strings explicitly contained within the GST.
 * In addition to those Strings, there are a set of different strings that are implicitly contained within the GST, and it is composed of
 * the strings built by concatenating e1.label + e2.label + ... + $end, where e1, e2, ... is a proper path and $end is prefix of any of
 * the labels of the edges starting from the last node of the path.
 * <p>
 * This kind of "implicit path" is important in the testAndSplit method.
 * <p>
